## Run this code for yourself

BASIC no longer comes standard on wwindows or mac machines so an interpretor is needed to run these BASIC scripts.

1. Download an interpretor
   
   I used the [BASIC-256 Interpretor](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kidbasic/) but other can be found with a quick google search. You could also use your [TI-83 Clculator](org/programming/columns/83plus-bas) to program in basic if you would prefer.
2. Clone this repo
3. Run the code in the BASIC interpretor
    - More to come on this...


## What is this repo?

I found this book at a thrift store in northern MN for $1. I am uploading all the code here and providing instructions on how to run it to keep this code available almost 4 decades later.

The structure of the folders is modeled after the 5 chapters of the book:
1. Logical and Relaxing Games
2. Teaching and Learning Games
3. Time- and Mind-Challenging Games
4. Skill and Intelligence Games
5. War and Logic Games
